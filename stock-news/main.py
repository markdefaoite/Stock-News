## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. AlphaVantage_api = "XBYW8H89B0WEAJSN"


AlphaVantage_api = "XBYW8H89B0WEAJSN"
news_api = "0a55c05c38d64083a119e3d7ca45879f"


stock_params = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol": STOCK,
    "apikey": AlphaVantage_api
}

response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=stock_params)
response.raise_for_status()
data = response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"]
data_list = [value for (key, value) in data.items()]
yesterday_data = data_list[0]
yesterday_closing_price = yesterday_data["4. close"]
print(yesterday_closing_price)

day_before_yesterday_data = data_list[1]
day_before_yesterday_closing_price = day_before_yesterday_data["4. close"]
print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price)

difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))

diff_percent =(difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100

if diff_percent > 5:
    print("Get News")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

#https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=tesla&from=2024-05-21&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=API_KEY

news_params = {
    "qInTitle": COMPANY_NAME,

three_articles = articles[:3]
print(three_articles)


#
# news_params = {
#     "q": COMPANY_NAME,
#     "from": yesterday,
#     "sortBy": "popularity",
#     "apiKey": news_api,
# }
#
# ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# # Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
# #HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.
#
# response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_params)
# response.raise_for_status()
# data = response.json()
# print(data)

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
